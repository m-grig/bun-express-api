# bun-api
Provides a starting point for creating apis with Bun. Uses express for api handling, and Bun sqlite for the databse. Simply swap the connection out and change the repo class to use a different database.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v0.4.0. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
